Welcome to the Correlator syslog server docker container
--------------------------------------------------------

Here are some command line recipes to get you going:

1. Display list of Correlator applications as defined in the Application
   configuration file:

syslog_server --apps

2. Run Correlator in a 'report only' mode. In this mode it will dump summaries
   of syslog records received on the exposed TCP port to the screen:

syslog_server --app report

3. Run in report-only mode, capturing and saving syslog records to a file. The
   file name will be in the server output:

syslog_server --app report --write-file

4. Run in report-only mode, taking input from a capture file:

syslog_server --app report --read-file <filename>
