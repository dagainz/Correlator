Welcome to the Correlator syslog server docker container
--------------------------------------------------------

Note:

You can add a --d argument to any of the examples below to increase
the logging (output) level to include debugging information.

Command line examples:

1. Run Correlator in "OpenSSH" reporting mode.
   **For use with the OpenSSH test container **

syslog_server --app ssh-report

2. Display list of Correlator applications as defined in the Application
   configuration file:

syslog_server --apps

3. Run Correlator in a 'report only' mode. In this mode it will dump summaries
   of syslog records received on the exposed TCP port to the screen:

syslog_server --app report

4. Run in report-only mode, capturing and saving syslog records to a file. The
   file name will be in the server output:

syslog_server --app report --write-file

5. Run in report-only mode, taking input from a capture file:

syslog_server --app report --read-file <filename>
