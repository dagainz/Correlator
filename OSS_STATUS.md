# This OSS Project is HEALTHY but CLOSED

[![OSS Status: Healthy, Closed][healthy-closed-badge]][healthy-closed-markdown]

## What does that mean?

This repository contains a proof of concept system in very early development, but it **is** in active development.

## What should you expect?

- This code is alpha quality at best, and is released as-is
- This has not been extensively tested and even so, has many known issues.

## How can you contribute?

This project is currently not accepting Pull Requests. I didn't anticipate anyone would like to contribute at this
point, but if I am wrong please contact me through the address in my commits.
