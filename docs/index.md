# Correlator

Correlator is a Python based framework for creating log data processing systems.

The goal of this project is to provide a proof of concept system capable of doing real work. It's almost there.

### Included features and highlights

- Integrated syslog server processes log data from a remote system and responds to detected events in real-time.
- Modular architecture separates pattern detection from taking desired actions with an event system.
- Provides Python APIs for custom detection modules and event handlers.
- Flexible configuration system ties any number of detection modules and event handlers, plus any related configuration 
  into named applications, which are dynamically loaded and configured. 
- Includes tools used for the capture and playback of syslog messages. This is useful for development of detection modules and event handlers.
- Included working detection modules and event handlers demonstrate a working system and serve as examples for custom development:
    - The OpenSSH login module detects various patterns from the log data generated by the Linux OpenSSH daemon and
      responds with events such as SSHDLoginSucceed, SSHDLoginFailed.
    - The Transmission module detects the successful completion of a bittorrent download by the Transmission system and
      responds with an event.
    - The **log** *system event handler* sends event details to the python log, which ends up in stdout (and docker logs if using docker).
    - The **csv** *system event handler* writes event data to rows in a CSV format file.
    - The **e-mail** *event handler*: Uses Mako to generates email message and send via SMTP.
    - The **sms** *event handler*: Send an SMS message via twilio.
- Docker support

### Helpful documentation links:


- [quick start](quickstart.md) get up and running.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) discusses the overall architecture in more depth.
- [Implementation](implementation.md) has more detail around the functionality in this release.

### Requirements

- Docker (recommended) or a Unix like system.
- Python 3.10

### Limitations and known issues

This project haphazardly grew from a one-off Python script used to analyze a log file for patterns, looking for an obscure problem.

As such, there are plenty of limitations and issues, like:

- This code is rapidly developing, so the interface and API is not yet stable.
- A lot of this stuff is half-baked. Like the event handlers.
- Single thread. An event handler blocking forever will halt the system.
- Limited exception handling currently results in a fragile system.
- The event system has no queue, storage, retry or even audit capability. Its fire-and-forget.
- The Application configuration system currently uses a JSON format file. It's tough on humans but easy for python.
