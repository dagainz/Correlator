# Correlator

A log processing system written in Python.

## Overview

Correlator is a proof of concept system that reads, processes, and takes action based on log data generated by other
systems and applications. It does this by leveraging a front end to read log records from a source, and presenting them
to one or more *modules* that can detect patterns in the data and dispatch events in response. Event handlers are then
employed to take action in response to these events.

With the TCP based syslog server front end included, this project provides a fully working syslog server that detects
and takes action on syslog data sent to it.

Correlator is implemented as a python package. 

## High level features

- Modular architecture promotes the creation and reuse of:
      - Additional front-end's, such as a custom logfile parser
      - Independent modules that *understand* related processes
      - Event handlers to perform custom actions. 
  
- RFC 5424 compliant TCP syslog server front end with packet capture and replay
- A reference module is included: *OpenSSH login*, that watch for and handle a few patterns.
- Event handlers to log, write event data to CSV, send E-mail and SMS messages are included
- A flexible configuration system to tie modules and handlers together into *applications*.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- A Unix like system, or Docker.

## Limitations and known issues

As this *is* a proof-of-concept at this point, there are many. Including:

- Single thread. An event handler blocking forever will stop the system.
- Limited exception handling, making the system fragile.
- The syslog server services a single connection.
- The event system has no retry capability. Its fire-and-forget.
